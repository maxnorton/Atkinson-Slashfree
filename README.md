# A high-legibility typeface for presentations

This is my version of [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont), the Braille Institute of America's high-legibility typeface designed with low-vision readers in mind. The only difference at present is that I've removed the distracting slash from the zero character.

The upstream ancestor of this fork is Atkinson Hyperlegible version 1.002, the most recent version as of 2023-12-14. Since my intended use is in Beamer presentations, I have only adapted the web font (as TTF). I have also included FontForge SFD files to facilitate any further modifications.
